Example for refer attribute from other resource :

resource "time_static" "time_update" {
}

resource "local_file" "time" {
    filename = "/root/time.txt"
    content = "Time stamp of this file is ${time_static.time_update.id}"
}

In resource "time", in content value, we take id from resource time_update
