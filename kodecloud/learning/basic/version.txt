Version constraint : 
- !=
- <
- >
- <=
- >=
- =
- ~> 
    - pessimistic constraint , example ~>1.0.4. In this case we can install 1.0.5 and 1.0.10, but not allow install 1.1.0
    - ~>1.1, it means we can download version 1.2 and 1.10, but we cannot install 2.0

Note : 
    - Give quotation mark ("") for version constraint

Example : "> 3.45.0, !=3.46.0, < 3.48.0" or "!=3.17.0"
