Depends_on
--> Used when we want to create a one resource after other resources created

Type of dependency in terraform : 
    - Implicit Dependencies 
        - we don't need tell to terraform which resource depends on/automatically assigned by provider
        - Example azure subnet will not be created, if we dont have azure vnet
        - Use reference expressions from attribute
    - Explicit Dependencies
        - we need tell to terraform which resource depends on
        - we can pass parameter depends_on in resource
        - One resource actually not really need id or other attribute from depended other resources

Example : 
resource "local_file" "raihan" {
    filename = "/root/gg"
    content = "raihan"
    depends_on = [local_file.arfi]
}

resource "local_file" "arfi" {
    filename = "/root/gg"
    content = "arfi"
}
